# Description
This week, we were tasked to create an application called `Shop-Shop`. This application was made to gain understanding of using STRIPE as well as the technologies we learned and covered in previous modules. To be successful we need to keep the following in mind:

- Explain and identify use cases for global state management.

- Use the Context API and React Hooks to manage Redux-like global state in a React application.

- Implement the Stripe payment platform in a MERN application.
- 

# Install
You can either choose to clone the repositiory and save it on your device, or you can access the deployed site using the link in the Deployed Site section of this ReadMe.

# Usage
`an e-commerce website that allows users to shop for goods`. This application uses `STRIPE` to handle and accept all forms of payment
